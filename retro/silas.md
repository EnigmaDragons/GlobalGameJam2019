Silas Reinagel - Retrospective Notes

## 1) What went well
- We successfully focused only on Mechanics and Presentation
- Incremental delivery approach worked great!
- GameState Management worked out very well
- There were plenty of foods and snacks
- Team communication and focus was excellent!

## 2) What didn't go well
- Mismatch between cards text and code
- IDEs sometimes mistakenly marked sections as unusued, causing confusing, and one bad refactor
- Eventing flows are still complex and need stronger guidance. UI events and game events are easy to get mixed up.

## 3) What lessons can we take moving forward
- Always stick with a pure focus on Mechanics or Content
- Always deliver a full MVP as fast as possible

## 4) What was your personal favorite part of the jam
- Seeing the cards go through iterations and refinements mid-jam

## 5) What is your favorite thing in the game
- The flying bed
- And the sweet "Countered" visual effect
